    r"""Encode ``frame`` as an ``arrays`` table.

    ``arrays`` is the only table format the contract defines today: an ordered
    list of column names and a list of row arrays positionally matching it.
    Arrow IPC is a reserved extension point everywhere in this system and is
    not implemented.

    Serialization is per column rather than per cell, because a column has one
    dtype and the rule for writing a value follows from it. The rows are then
    transposed out of the serialized columns, which is what keeps a column's
    values consistently written even where a row-major walk would see mixed
    types.

    A frame with no columns still carries its row count, so an empty-column
    table is a list of empty rows rather than an empty table. The two mean
    different things to the server.

    Args:
        frame: The rows to encode.
        dtypes: Wire dtype per column name. Must cover every column of
            ``frame``.
