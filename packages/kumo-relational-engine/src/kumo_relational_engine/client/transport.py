"""What the RFM path requires of a transport, and the reply it reads back.

:class:`~kumo_relational_engine.client.client.Client` speaks HTTP to a Universal TFM NIM
and hands back a ``requests.Response``. A managed-platform transport invokes a
model served by name and hands back a :class:`ServingResponse` -- no HTTP
session, no base URL, no ``requests.Response``. None of them derives from
another.

These are :class:`~typing.Protocol` rather than a union of the concrete classes.
A union has to name every implementation, so each new platform edits this module
and drags its dependencies into anything that imports it. The shared call sites
(``RFMAPI`` and ``raise_on_error``) do not care which transport they hold, only
that it can be asked for a prediction and closed; structural typing states
exactly that, and lets a transport be added without touching this file.

``_request`` is private by convention but is part of this contract: it is the
seam the RFM path calls, so naming it here makes it a stated requirement rather
than one discovered by reading call sites.
