r"""What a prediction has to say about itself afterwards.

A prediction that comes back wrong days later can only be explained if the run
that produced it can be reconstructed: which graph, under which engine, for which
query, at which anchor. Predictions are not deterministic and the data underneath
them moves, so re-running the question does not reveal what happened the first
time.

One record is emitted per prediction, whether it returned, refused, or raised. It
names the run rather than describing it: a graph fingerprint, versions, counts and
timings. No entity identifiers and no cell values, since both are the caller's
data. It goes to the ``kumo_relational_engine`` logger rather than to the progress
display, which belongs to whoever is watching the call rather than to whoever has
to explain it later.
