def _unsafe_expr_reason(expr: str) -> str | None:
    r"""Returns why a column expression must not be lifted out of a remote

    A semantic/metric view is authored by a third party, yet its column
    expressions are spliced verbatim into sampler queries and run under the
    caller's warehouse role. A scalar expression never needs a statement
    separator, a comment or a sub-query, so those are refused while
    arithmetic, casts, ``CASE`` and function calls are left alone.

    Keywords are matched only outside string literals and quoted identifiers,
    since a keyword inside one is data rather than SQL and rejecting it would
    drop a legitimate column. The token check deliberately stays on the raw
    expression: quoting rules vary by dialect, so a separator or comment must
    not become invisible just because this function believes it is quoted.

    Deciding what counts as quoted is itself dialect-specific, and getting it
    wrong hands an attacker the whole guard. Snowflake also has ``$$...$$``,
    and both Snowflake and Databricks honour backslash escapes inside a
    literal, so a payload that writes its quotes as ``$$`` or ``\'`` shifts
    where a doubling-only reader believes the literal ends and smuggles a
    sub-query through the gap. Both forms are therefore recognised. Anything
    left over that still looks like a delimiter means this function's model of
    the string boundaries disagrees with the warehouse's, so it fails closed
    rather than scanning a string it cannot account for -- which also refuses
    a quoted name ending in a lone backslash (invalid on Databricks, exotic on
    Snowflake).

    ``INSERT`` and ``TRUNCATE`` are also ordinary Snowflake scalar functions,
    and as statements are always followed by ``INTO``/``TABLE`` rather than by
    ``(``, so a call cannot be one. A keyword directly behind a ``.`` is the
    trailing part of a qualified name (``ORDERS.MERGE``), which likewise
    cannot begin a statement -- unlike ``SELECT``, which may legally be
    followed by ``(``, so it stays refused either way.

        r"""Creates a :class:`Graph` from a Databricks Unity Catalog metric
        view.

        The star/snowflake schema of the metric view is converted into a
        graph: the ``source`` table becomes a fact table, every join becomes
        a linked table named after its join alias, and every dimension
        becomes an (expression) column on the table it references. Measures
        define aggregations rather than row-level values and are therefore
        not part of the graph; use a predictive query to express aggregations
        instead. Elements that cannot be represented in a graph are dropped
        with a warning.

        A dimension expression becomes SQL that later runs under your own
        warehouse credentials, so the view definition is executable input.
        Expressions that are not plain scalar expressions -- ones carrying a
        statement separator, a comment or a sub-query -- are dropped with a
        warning; load metric views you trust.

        r"""Creates a :class:`Graph` from a Snowflake semantic view.

        The semantic view's logical tables become graph tables backed by their
        ``base_table``, and its ``relationships`` become edges. Dimensions,
        time dimensions and facts become columns; an ``expr`` that is just the
        column name (optionally qualified with its own table) is treated as a
        plain column, any other ``expr`` becomes an expression column.

        These elements cannot be represented in a graph and are dropped with a
        warning listing each one:

        - **Metrics.** They define aggregations rather than row-level values;
          express aggregations with a predictive query instead.
        - **Composite primary keys** and **composite relationship keys**.
        - **Columns whose expression references another logical table.**
        - **Relationships whose referencing (left) key is itself a primary
          key**, i.e. one-to-one relationships. Note a view made only of such
          relationships yields a graph with no edges at all.

        The time column of each table is inferred, preferring the view's
        ``time_dimensions``; correct it with
        ``graph['table'].time_column = 'column'`` if the inference is wrong.

        ``semantic_view_name`` is passed to Snowflake as written, so an
        unqualified name resolves against the connection's current database and
        schema. Qualify it (``'MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.MY_VIEW'``) to reach another one.

        Many forecasting datasets arrive as a single table where each row
        represents one entity and a column holds an array of historical
        observations.  This method converts such a table into the two-table
        *(entity + target)* structure expected by Kumo Relational and returns a
        ready-to-use predictive query.

        The input ``df`` is split into:

        * An entity table - one row per input row, containing all columns
          except ``timeseries_col`` (and ``timestamps_col`` when given).
        * A target table - one row per observation, with a foreign-key to
          the entity table, a timestamp column, and the observed value.

            timestamps_col: Optional name of the column containing per-entity
                timestamp arrays (one timestamp per observation value).  Must
                be the same length as ``timeseries_col`` for every row.  When
                ``None``, synthetic timestamps are generated backwards from
                ``anchor_time`` using ``time_delta``.
            time_delta: Step size between consecutive observations.  Required
                when ``timestamps_col`` is ``None``.  Also controls the

                ``timestamps_col`` is provided and ``time_delta`` is ``None``,
                the typical step is inferred from the median inter-observation
                interval across all entities.
            anchor_time: The forecast cutoff timestamp.  Required when
                ``timestamps_col`` is ``None``; used to place synthetic
                timestamps so that the last observation falls at
                ``anchor_time - time_delta``.  Pass the same value to
                :meth:`KumoRelational.predict` as ``anchor_time``.
            entity_col: Name of an existing column to use as the entity
                primary key.  When ``None``, integer IDs ``[0, 1, ..., n-1]``
                are generated and stored in a new column named ``entity_id``.
            num_timeframes: Number of timeframes to forecast.

        Returns:
            A tuple ``(graph, pquery)`` where *graph* is a :class:`Graph`
            ready for use with :class:`KumoRelational` and *pquery* is a
