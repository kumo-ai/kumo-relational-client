r"""A name for the shape of a graph, stable enough to key a cache on.

A caller that reuses a built graph needs to know when the one it holds is still
the graph the question would produce. ``hash()`` cannot answer that: Python salts
string hashing per process, so the same graph names itself differently in two
workers, and the built-in covers only table names and edges, so a column that
changed type, a key that moved and a time column that appeared all leave the
name untouched.

This walks the whole shape a prediction depends on, writes it in a fixed order,
and hashes the bytes. Two graphs that would behave identically get one name;
anything a prediction can see changes it.

The engine version is part of it. Rebuilding the same tables under a version
that reads them differently is a different graph, and a cache that could not
tell them apart would serve the older reading indefinitely.

Format
------
Every field is written as its length in characters, a colon, then its text, and
the fields are concatenated. Nothing separates them, because the length says
where each one ends, so no value can be mistaken for a delimiter.

The order is: the format version, then each table sorted by name, then the
edges sorted, then the edges inference guessed. A table is its name, its column
count, then each column in the order the table holds it as name, semantic type
and storage type; then its declared key columns in order preceded by their
count; then its primary key, time column and end time column.
