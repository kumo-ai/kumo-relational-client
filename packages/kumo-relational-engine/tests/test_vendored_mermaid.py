r"""Checks that the vendored mermaid bundle is upstream bytes, unmodified.

The third-party attribution in the root LICENSE is enumerated from the mermaid
release named in VENDORED.md. That enumeration is only truthful while the file
on disk is the file upstream published, so the digest is pinned and checked
here rather than trusted.

This exists because a repo-wide identifier rename once rewrote two strings
inside the minified bundle, turning a vendored artifact into a modified one
without changing its stated provenance.
