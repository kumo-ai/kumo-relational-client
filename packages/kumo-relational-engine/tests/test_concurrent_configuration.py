r"""Two callers configuring one model at the same time.

``batch_mode`` and ``retry`` used to hold their setting on the instance, so a
model shared by concurrent callers served whichever value was set last. A caller
inside its own ``batch_mode(100)`` could be batched at 500 because another thread
had entered meanwhile, and the restore on exit put back a value that was already
someone else's.

The setting is per execution context now, which is what a caching client needs:
one model, many concurrent predictions, each with the configuration it asked for.
