r"""Recording which edges were guessed rather than declared.

Link inference reads names and values to guess a relationship, so a graph built
without catalog edges is partly a guess. Nothing said which parts, which leaves a
caller unable to explain why a prediction came out as it did, and leaves a cache
unable to tell one guessed shape from another.
