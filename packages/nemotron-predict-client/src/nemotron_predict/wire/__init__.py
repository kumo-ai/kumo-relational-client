r"""The Universal TFM wire format, in one place.

Every model posts the same envelope to ``POST /v1/predictions``; the server
tells them apart by the ``model`` field alone. These modules own the parts of
that envelope that are the same whatever the model is: how a column's dtype is
named, how a cell is written, and how a frame becomes an ``arrays`` table.

The boundary is DataFrames plus plain metadata. Nothing here knows what a
graph, a subgraph or a predictive query is, which is what lets the relational
path reach the same code: its adapter samples first and arrives with frames
like any other.
