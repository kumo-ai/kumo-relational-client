    application's logging. Handling our own records here and not propagating
    them keeps the previous console output without touching anyone else's.

    An application that has already configured logging owns the output format,
    so nothing is installed in that case and records are left to propagate to
    its handlers. Installing ours unconditionally meant a host doing structured
    logging could neither capture these records (``propagate`` was off) nor
    format them.
