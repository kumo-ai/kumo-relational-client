        still hold it for an in-flight prediction.

        Auto-init from an ambient ``NEMOTRON_STRUCTURED_API_ENDPOINT`` is gated on

    endpoint does not advertise one.

    Re-initializing with identical arguments is a no-op, as for :func:`init`.
    That matters more here: when ``workspace_client`` is omitted, building the
    client resolves ambient Databricks credentials, and callers score in
    partitions by calling this once per batch. The unchanged check therefore
    runs before anything is constructed, and the endpoint is validated before
    that, so a rejected name leaves the process exactly as it was, log level
    included. Overrides are forwarded only when given, leaving the transport
    owning its own defaults and their validation.

    Args:
        endpoint: The serving endpoint name.
        workspace_client: An existing ``WorkspaceClient``. When omitted one is
            built from the ambient Databricks configuration, which is how a

        timeout: Overrides the request timeout, in seconds. Applies only when
