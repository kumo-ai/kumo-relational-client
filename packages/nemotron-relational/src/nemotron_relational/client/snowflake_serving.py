"""Invoke Kumo RFM through a Snowpark Container Services model service.

The peer of :mod:`nemotron_relational.client.databricks_serving`, and the same contract:
one ``request_json`` row in, one ``response_json`` row out. What differs is how
the service is reached.

A Snowflake model service is invoked as a SQL method on the service,
``SELECT <service>!PREDICT(?)``, over a Snowpark session or a Snowflake
connection. That is deliberate rather than a REST call to the service's ingress:
ingress has to be enabled explicitly, is reachable only by users of the account
that created it, and carries a 90-second connection timeout, whereas the SQL
path works from a Snowflake notebook with the session already in hand and from
outside with ordinary warehouse credentials.

The request travels as a bind parameter, never interpolated into the statement.
A canonical RFM request is megabytes of sampled customer rows; splicing it into
SQL would put customer data in the query text, and query text is logged, shown
in history and truncated at a statement-size limit far below the payload cap.
