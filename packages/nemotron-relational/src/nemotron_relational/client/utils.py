    r"""Raises an :class:`~nemotron_relational.exceptions.HTTPException` if a response does
    not return with an OK status code.

    The body is capped: a NIM behind a proxy can answer an error with a large
    HTML page, and the whole of it used to become the exception message. The
    response is already bounded by the read cap, which is measured in
    megabytes, so the cap here is what keeps the message readable.

    A missing status code is reported rather than asserted. This is the path
    every failed request takes, and under ``python -O`` an assertion here is
    removed entirely: the status went on to ``http.HTTPStatus(None)``, which
    raised an unrelated ``TypeError`` and hid the real failure.
