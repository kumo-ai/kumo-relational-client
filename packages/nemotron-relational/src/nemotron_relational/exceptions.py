    ``except NemotronRelationalError`` is the one catch that covers the whole client. Each
    subclass also keeps the built-in base it historically raised
    (:class:`ValueError`, :class:`RuntimeError`), so code written against the
    older, rootless hierarchy keeps working unchanged.
    """


class ClientInitializationError(NemotronRelationalError, ValueError):
    r"""The client could not be pointed at a usable NIM.

    Raised while establishing the connection rather than while serving a
    prediction, so the request itself was never sent. The subclasses separate
    the cases worth reacting to differently: bad credentials are not worth a
    retry, an unreachable or slow server usually is.
    """


class AuthenticationError(ClientInitializationError):
    r"""The NIM (or the gateway in front of it) rejected the credentials.

    NIMs are unauthenticated by contract, so this only happens behind an
    authenticating gateway, and means the ``api_key`` is missing or wrong.

    The driver's own exception is kept as ``__cause__``. Without this, reading
    a warehouse raised whatever that driver raises -- a
    ``databricks.sql.exc.ServerOperationError``, a
    ``snowflake.connector.errors.ProgrammingError`` -- none of which share a
    base with anything else this client raises, so building a graph could not be
    guarded by the same ``except`` as using one.

class InvalidResponseError(NemotronRelationalError, ValueError):
    r"""The NIM answered, but its response does not match the contract.

    Subclasses :class:`ValueError` so existing callers keep working, while
    letting the client report a malformed *server* response as such instead of
    blaming the caller's request. It also stops a body that will never parse
    from being retried as though the NIM were merely busy.

    Subclasses :class:`RuntimeError` so existing callers keep working, and
    carries the structured facts a caller (or the ``kumo-relational-client`` adapter) needs
    to map it onto its own error hierarchy without re-parsing the message:
    the HTTP status, the problem document's ``detail``, its RFC-9457
    ``invalid_params`` entries, and whether the failure looks transient.
