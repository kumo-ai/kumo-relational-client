"""``kumorfm.rfm.init_databricks_serving``, without the native extension.

``kumorfm/rfm/backend/local/__init__.py`` does a bare ``import
kumorfm.kumolib`` at module scope and turns any failure into a RuntimeError, so
``import kumorfm.rfm`` is impossible wherever the compiled extension is absent.

That guard exists for the *local* sampler. The Databricks Model Serving path
never touches it -- inference happens on the endpoint. Satisfying the guard with
a stub is therefore not papering over a real dependency; it demonstrates that
the dependency is not real for this path, which is the argument for making the
import lazy.
