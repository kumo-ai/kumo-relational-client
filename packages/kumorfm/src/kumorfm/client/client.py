    status retries on the method but not connect ones, and a request that never

    ``read=False`` switches off read retries entirely. A read timeout on a

    the most expensive work in the system on a GPU that is by hypothesis
    struggling; the request-level ``predict(num_retries=...)`` is the layer that

    ``False`` rather than ``0`` also re-raises the underlying ``ReadTimeout``
    instead of burying it in a ``MaxRetryError``, which is what lets the caller

        given it is sent as the ``X-API-Key`` header, otherwise no auth header

        ``timeout`` bounds each individual request attempt, in seconds.
        ``None`` (the default) leaves requests unbounded, so a hung NIM blocks
        the caller until the connection drops.

        ``max_retries`` bounds the transport-level retries of a transient

        retries the prediction call itself at the application level and is what
        covers a read timeout.

        ``POST /v1/sessions`` is held out of the retries: creating a session
        pins the context in the worker's memory before the response is written,
        so a re-sent create leaves one orphaned pinned context per attempt that
        no ``session_id`` can release. ``requests`` resolves an adapter by
