r"""Spelling of table and column names in a predictive query.

A warehouse accepts names a predictive query's bare identifier cannot spell,
such as ``Customer ID``. Those are written backtick-quoted, and the quoting is
a spelling device only: once parsed, the AST holds the name the data itself
uses, so nothing downstream needs to know a name was ever quoted.
:func:`fqn` puts the quotes back when a query is rendered.

This module deliberately sits outside ``kumorfm/pql`` and ``kumorfm/api``,
which are vendored trees that a re-sync deletes and re-copies wholesale. Both
import from here, so the spelling rules survive a re-sync on their own.
