r"""Identity spread across more than one column.

A warehouse often identifies a row by a combination of columns rather than by
one: a customer dimension partitioned by region holds one row per
``(customer, region)`` pair, and neither column alone is unique. A graph needs
a single node identity, and the serving contract carries a single
``instance_id`` per instance, so such a key is folded here into one derived
value.

The fold has to agree **exactly** on both sides of a join. Seed identities are
built in pandas while a SQL backend joins by evaluating an expression in the
warehouse, and a single character of disagreement produces no matched rows
rather than an error. Every value is therefore rendered by one documented rule,
and a part whose text a warehouse would render differently is refused outright
rather than trusted.
