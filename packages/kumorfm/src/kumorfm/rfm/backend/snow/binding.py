    Server-side ``qmark`` binding is how a caller-supplied name or value
    reaches Snowflake as data rather than as SQL text. Snowflake honours
    backslash escapes inside single-quoted literals, so building a literal by
    doubling quotes is not sufficient escaping; see
    ``bugs/security-discovery-sql-quote-ident-backslash-injection.md``.

    This lives in its own module so both the table and the sampler layers can
    bind without importing each other.

    The connection is usually owned by the caller, so the previous style is
    restored no matter how the block exits.
